Hello World Repository to know the basics of GitHub.

Well, this is my first repository on GitHub.

I study Information Systems at Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro(UNIRIO).
Though I'm on second year, I spent almost four years at UFRJ studing Computer Science. Thus, I'll graduate with two and a half years at UNIRIO.
